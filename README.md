# Final Project: Paradise Nursery Shopping App

For your final project, you will develop the front end of a "Paradise Nursery" shopping app. The app's interface will allow users to browse a range of houseplants and add them to a shopping cart. The cart will display all the selected items and their total price, and users should be able to adjust the quantity of each item before proceeding to checkout.

Working on the practice project will prepare you for the final project. We designed the practice project so that much of the code, components, and skills you develop there can be applied to this peer-reviewed project with some modifications.

Your app should consist of three pages: a landing page, a product listing page, and a shopping cart page. Refer to the lab for specific functionality details for each page, and watch the product walkthrough video to see how the completed app should look and function.

<h2>Landing Page</h2>

The landing page should include the following elements:
1. A background image
2. A paragraph describing the company
3. The companyâ€™s name
4. A "Get Started" button that links to the product page

<h2>Product Listing Page</h2>

The product listing page should feature at least six houseplants, grouped into three or more categories. Each plant should have:
1. A thumbnail image
2. The plant's name
3. The price
4. An "Add to Cart" button

Both the product listing and shopping cart pages should have a header that includes a shopping cart icon. This icon should dynamically update to show the total number of items in the cart. The header should also have navigation links to the other pages, depending on which page the user is on.

<h2>Shopping Cart Page</h2>

The shopping cart page should display all the items in the cart, including:
- The total number of plants
- The total cost of all items
- A "Continue Shopping" button
- A "Checkout" button

Each item in the cart should be shown with its thumbnail, name, unit price, and the total cost for that plant type. You should provide buttons to increase or decrease the quantity of each plant, which will update both the shopping cart icon in the header and the total number of items in the cart. Additionally, there should be a "Delete" button for each plant in the cart.
